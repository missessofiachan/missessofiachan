### 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Page!

Hello! I'm **Sofia**, a passionate software developer with a love for creating efficient and scalable applications.
Welcome to my personal GitHub page where you can learn more about me, my projects, and my journey in the wonderful world
of technology.

### 🛠️ About Me

I am a software developer based in Australia, specializing in cybersecurity, front-end, and back-end programming. I thrive on tackling challenging problems and continuously expanding my skill set. Fascinated by technology's endless possibilities since I started using computers at the age of five, I believe in its power to transform lives and make the world a better place, just as it has done for me.

I have completed a Certificate IV in Cybersecurity and a Certificate IV in Programming at Holmesglen TAFE, where I developed a strong foundation in programming, databases, web development, and software testing. In 2025, I plan to further my education by undertaking a Diploma in Programming.
