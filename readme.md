### 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Page!

Hello! I'm **Sofia**, a passionate software developer with a love for creating efficient and scalable applications.
Welcome to my personal GitHub page where you can learn more about me, my projects, and my journey in the wonderful world
of technology.

### 🛠️ About Me

I am a software developer based in Australia. I specialize in cybersecurity and front-end and back-end programming. I
enjoy tackling challenging problems and continuously expanding my skill set. I've been using computers since I was five
years old and have always been fascinated by the endless possibilities technology offers. I am a strong believer in the
power of technology to transform lives and make the world a better place, as it has done for me. I have completed a
Certificate IV in Cybersecurity and am currently finishing a Certificate IV in Programming at Holmesglen TAFE. I am
planning to undertake a Diploma in Programming the year 2025.
