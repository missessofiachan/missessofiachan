### 🛠️ About Me

I'm a software developer based in Australia, specializing in **cybersecurity**, **front-end**, and **back-end programming**.  
I've been fascinated with technology since I was five years old, and that love has only grown. Technology has transformed my life, and I’m dedicated to using it to make the world a better place.

I’ve completed a **Certificate IV in Cybersecurity** and a **Certificate IV in Programming** at Holmesglen TAFE, where I built a solid foundation in software development, databases, and testing.  
In 2025, I’m continuing my journey by studying the **Diploma of IT (Advanced Programming & Back-End Web Development)**.
